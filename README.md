# fifa-api-challenge
api to manage data about qualified football teams to the world cup ‚öΩüó∫Ô∏è

# Getting started

To get started quickly, use the following bootstrapped scripts to make things easier.

A detailed step by step description is:

```
make requirements # Create virtual environment and install requirements
make restart # Delete and clear any previous work to start fresh
make load_data # Load initial data
make run # Start the dev server
```

The development server should have started now. You can visit the fifa stats API by navigating in a browser to : `http://localhost:8000/api/teams/stats`.

`http://localhost:8000/api/teams/` and `http://localhost:8000/api/players/` is also available.
